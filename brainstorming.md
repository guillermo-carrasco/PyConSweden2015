## Brainstorming

**What do we want to talk about?**

* Data management and the importance of automation: Disks filling up
  quickly, long term storage importance, manual -> error prone and spikes of
  work.

* Data analysis: NGI-pipeline description (it will be more mature
  by the time of the presentation)

* Open source!!! Remark that all our code is open source, definitely
  link to the [open source site][open-source].
  - Develop according to open source model: good documentation practices
  - This is a good way to end the talk I think!

* Important take aways
  - Include code snippets!
  - "Try" to include humor, even forced humor
