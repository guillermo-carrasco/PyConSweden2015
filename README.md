# Proposal sketch for PyCon Sweden 2015

### Title

Python in Life Sciences:
How Python Drives the Analysis of Billions of DNA Sequences

### Category

Science

### Duration

I would prefer a 30 minutes slot

### Description

A genomics research center produces larges amount of data per day; a single one of
the new [Illumina machines](http://www.illumina.com/systems/hiseq-x-sequencing-system/performance-specifications.html)
for sequencing can produce around 2TB of data composed of millions of files in under 3 days.

The first part will focus on how we use Python for the management and automated
analysis of billions of DNA sequences for research focused projects.

The second part will tell the story of how Python is at the center of a medical revolution. It will focus on how we have fundamentally changed the way we deliver data to "regular" clinicians using a Flask powered website.

### Audience

- Any Python programmer with interest in how Python is applied to the growing
  life sciences field of genomics.

- Any scientist with interest in how other labs are managing the complex data
  flow and analysis of a genomics facility.

### Python level

Intermediate - Advanced

### Objectives

The attendees will learn about a state of the art genomics pipeline and
how we use Python to manage, store and analyze large amounts of biologically-significant data.

They will also get a peek behind the website that allows clinicians to
productively review results from DNA sequencing and make life-changing
diagnoses.

### Detailed abstract
TODO: Do we need to write this? I think it's covered elsewhere, no?

### Outline
TODO: how long are we planning to speak? 10 + 10 + 5 min + Q&A?

**Introduction**

**Part 1**

**Part 2**

1. Introduce DNA sequencing + the role of Python in the clinic (5 min)

2. Scout, our web-based data delivery interface (10 min)
  1. From Excel sheet to Flask website
  2. From JavaScript-mess to Python-bliss

**Finale**

1. Doing everything in open source; GitHub, documentation, [...]
2. Promoting great project through our open source portal
