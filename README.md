### Title

Python in Life Sciences:
How Python Drives the Analysis of Billions of DNA Sequences

### Category

Science

### Duration

30 minutes

### Description

A genomics research center produces larges amount of data per day; a single one of
the new [Illumina machines](http://www.illumina.com/systems/hiseq-x-sequencing-system/performance-specifications.html)
for sequencing can produce around 2TB of data composed of millions of files in under 3 days.

The first part will focus on how Python manages the preprocessing and analysis of billions
of DNA sequences in a completely automated way. We will also cover how sequencing results
are visualized using Flask and MongoEngine to solve medical mysteries in the clinic today.

### Audience

- Any Python programmer with interest in how Python is applied to the growing
  life sciences field of genomics.

- Any scientist with interest in how other labs are managing the complex data
  flow and analysis of a genomics facility.

### Python level

Intermediate

### Objectives

The attendees will learn about a state of the art genomics pipeline and
how we use Python to manage, store and analyze large amounts of biologically-significant data.

They will also get a peek behind the website that allows clinicians to
productively review results from DNA sequencing and make life-changing
diagnoses.


### Additional notes

The content of the presentation is structured into [3 different parts](/parts).
On each part there is a `slides.md` file that accompany the slides for that part,
which are located in the same directory under the name `presentation.key`

The complete slides set is located [here](/presentation.key).
