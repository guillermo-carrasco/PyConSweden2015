# Proposal sketch for PyCon Sweden 2015

## Some notes and suggestions on how to make a proposal

* [Proposal advice](https://us.pycon.org/2015/speaking/proposal_advice/)
* [Proposal resources](https://us.pycon.org/2015/speaking/proposal-resources/)
* [Proposal sample](https://us.pycon.org/2015/speaking/proposal_advice/samples/SpacePug/)

## Brainstorming

**What do I want to talk about?**

* Brief introduction of Genomics (really short, jsut to explain where the data comes
from, how is it generated, why is it useful)
* Why python: Easy to learn, powerful, perfect for "guleing" (if that word even exists), enormous amount of library, high community support
* Data management: the importance of automation: Disks filling up quickly, long term storage importance, manual --> error prone and spikes of work.
* Data analysis: NGI-pipeline description (hopefully it will be more mature by the time of the presentation)
* Clinical use cases: Up to Robin :-)
* Open source!!! Remark that all our code is opensource, definitely link to the open source site.

## Proposal

### Title

Python in life sciences: How Python drives the analysis of billions of DNA sequences

### Category

Science

sciences field of Genomics. Any scientist with interest on how other labs are managing
the complex data flow and analysis on a genomics facility.

### Python level

Intermediate - Advanced

### Objectives

The attendees will learn about a state of the art genomics pipelina and how we use
Python to manage and analyse larges amount of biologically significant data.
