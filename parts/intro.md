# Introduction

## 1. What makes Python uniquely capable of handling NGS data?
*Even to people outside science, I think this could be an interesting topic.*

## 2. Who are these two guys?
Spanish vs. Swedish, CS vs. Biology, DevOps vs. Design

### Robin Andeer
My name is Robin Andeer and I solve medical mysteries at SciLifeLab. Many people would probably label me a "scientific programmer".

#### Anecdote
Many people spend a lot of time doing research. When it comes time to analyze your data you often realize that no one has built something to meet your specific research-y needs.

So you start to inch your way to becoming a programmer to accomplish your goals. All of a sudden you notice you are really more of a developer than a researcher. Your mindset has changed and you find these new technical problems very interesting in their own to tackle.

It's very motivating to still have the medical/research goals in the background, but still. This was at least my own experience. Starting in the lab in school, and now I'm sitting in front of a computer all day - and couldn't be happier to be on the other side of the glass walls.

I believe this story resonates with many "scientific" programmers. Some of the most influential developers in the field are ex-researchers that have initially taught themselves to code. Brad Chapman, Aaron Quinlan, etc. [insert GH streak] Do you think he has time for lab work anymore? Hehe. Now *they* are pushing the envelope when it comes to building scientific software. As a general purpose yet simple language for beginners, this is probably also why Python is so prevalent in bioinformatics. In fact Python is at near monopoly in Science ([ref][monopoly]). There's a big open source community (numpy, pandas) which ties really well into the academia heave field. A downside is that many groups are still transitioning to using Git and testing for example.

### Guillermo Carrasco

My name is Guillermo Carrasco and I am a software engineer infiltrated between biologists :)

To be honest, I ended up in Life Sciences by pure chance. A couple of years ago I was
looking for a part time job to pay my engineering studies in Spain, and I saw a system
administration job advertisement at the Molecular Biology Institute of Barcelona. After
applying and being hired, I started working with people that were so passionate
about what they were doing that they were willing to learn how to code by themselves
in order to achieve what they were looking for. I've always admire that so much, took
me 5 years of university!

I decided to do my Msc.Thesis abroad and this is how I ended up in Science For Life
Laboratory, where my interest on life science has been growing and growing, always
motivated by the strong open source and collaborative environment that is
growing among scientists.

Nowadays I spend my day helping researchers with data management and software development.

## 3. Misc.
Reverse the question: what if Python didn't exist?
  - Where would that have left us?
  - It's an impossible question but it's sort of scary to imagine that reality... Perl...
  - I think at least we are better off with our current situation!
