# What makes Python uniqely capable of handling NGS data?
This is a point that I think could really work well to speak a little about even to people that aren't into scientific Python per se.


## Reasons

- Many people in the field gravitate toward it

- Many (leading) developers come from a biology background (simple to learn etc.)
  + Work with CS people (common ground)
  + Still CS bioinformatics groups are still transitioning to use Git, testing
  + For many the end goal is still the scientific result/publication, software engineering matters less if it produces results when they need it.
  + Some notable people advocating reproducability and making stuff easier to install

- Key projects like Numpy and Pandas (vs. R) => Community, community, community

- *Very* general purpose! Unification (scripts, pipelines, processing, servers/UIs) => for others this is JavaScript, hehe

- Reverse the question: what if Python didn't exist - where would that have left us? It's an impossible question but it's sort of scary to imagine that reality... Perl... I think at least we are better off with our current situation!

- Open source is getting really big in bioinformatics! Academia :)
  + The options are: Matlab, R, Perl
  + Python has a much bigger open source legacy and community


## Anecdote
You spend time doing research and collecting lots of data. You realize you need to analyze your data and no one has built something to meet your specific needs.

So you start to inch your way to becoming a programmer to accomplish your goals. All of a sudden you notice you are really more of a developer than a researcher. Your mindset has changed and you find these new technical problems very interesting in their own to tackle.

It's very motivating to still have the medical/research goals in the background, but still. This was at least my own experience. Starting in the lab in school, and now I'm sitting in front of a computer all day - and couldn't be happier to be on the other side of the glass walls.
