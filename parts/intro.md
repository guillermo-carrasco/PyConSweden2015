# What makes Python uniquely capable of handling NGS data?
*Even to people outside science, I think this could be an interesting topic.*

## Who are we?
Spanish vs. Swedish, CS vs. Biology, Design vs. Automation [see presentation]

"Hi, my name is Robin Andeer and I help solve medical mysteries at SciLifeLab in Stockholm using Python."

## Background & reasons
1. Many people in the life science field gravitate towards Python
  - Python is at near monopoly in Science ([ref][monopoly])
2. Many leading developers come from a biology background
  - End goal: scientific result/publication
    + software engineering matters less if it produces results right now
  - Simple to learn
    + Groups are still transitioning to using Git and testing
    + General purpose! Unification of scripts, pipelines, processing, viz
      * ... for others this would be JavaScript ;-)
3. Python has a large scientific Python community
  - Key projects like Numpy and Pandas (vs. R)
  - Open source is getting really big in bioinformatics! Academia :)
    + The options are: Matlab, R, Perl
    + Python has a much bigger open source legacy and community
4. Reverse the question: what if Python didn't exist?
  - Where would that have left us?
  - It's an impossible question but it's sort of scary to imagine that reality... Perl...
  - I think at least we are better off with our current situation!


## Anecdote
You spend time doing research and collecting lots of data. You realize you need to analyze your data and no one has built something to meet your specific research-y needs.

So you start to inch your way to becoming a programmer to accomplish your goals. All of a sudden you notice you are really more of a developer than a researcher. Your mindset has changed and you find these new technical problems very interesting in their own to tackle.

It's very motivating to still have the medical/research goals in the background, but still. This was at least my own experience. Starting in the lab in school, and now I'm sitting in front of a computer all day - and couldn't be happier to be on the other side of the glass walls.

I believe this story resonates with many "scientific" programmers. Some of the most influential developers in the field are ex-researchers. There are some indications that commercial interests are shifting things (Genalice, Illumina).
