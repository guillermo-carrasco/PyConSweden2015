# Introduction

## 1. What makes Python uniquely capable of handling NGS data?
*Even to people outside science, I think this could be an interesting topic.*

## 2. Who are these two guys?
Spanish vs. Swedish, CS vs. Biology, Design vs. DevOps

### Robin Andeer
My name is Robin Andeer and I solve medical mysteries at SciLifeLab. Many people would probably label me a "scientific programmer".

#### Anecdote
Many people spend a lot of time doing research. When it comes time to analyze your data you often realize that no one has built something to meet your specific research-y needs.

So you start to inch your way to becoming a programmer to accomplish your goals. All of a sudden you notice you are really more of a developer than a researcher. Your mindset has changed and you find these new technical problems very interesting in their own to tackle.

It's very motivating to still have the medical/research goals in the background, but still. This was at least my own experience. Starting in the lab in school, and now I'm sitting in front of a computer all day - and couldn't be happier to be on the other side of the glass walls.

I believe this story resonates with many "scientific" programmers. Some of the most influential developers in the field are ex-researchers that have initially taught themselves to code. Brad Chapman, Aaron Quinlan, etc. [insert GH streak] Do you think he has time for lab work anymore? Hehe. Now *they* are pushing the envelope when it comes to building scientific software. As a general purpose yet simple language for beginners, this is probably also why Python is so prevalent in bioinformatics. In fact Python is at near monopoly in Science ([ref][monopoly]). There's a big open source community (numpy, pandas) which ties really well into the academia heave field. A downside is that many groups are still transitioning to using Git and testing for example.

## 3. Misc.
Reverse the question: what if Python didn't exist?
  - Where would that have left us?
  - It's an impossible question but it's sort of scary to imagine that reality... Perl...
  - I think at least we are better off with our current situation!
