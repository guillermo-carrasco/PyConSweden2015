# Doing everything open source
This is kind of a nice opportunity to tie back to working in academia. Companies can open source some tools but we can really expand the concept much further I think.

## Pointers

1. Open source is great but you need to push for it at work
  - We've built an open source portal to showcase in house projects

2. Benefits
  - Get's everyone to learn and use Git and GitHub
  - Get's people to open there eyes to use cases beyond "us"

3. Debunking security concerns?
